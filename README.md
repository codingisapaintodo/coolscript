# coolscript
coolscript is a windows exculsive coding langauge inspired by swift, once i saw people building awesome projects with swift and swiftui
but when i found out the swift version apple realsed for windows only allows for commands in the termanial i was disapointed,coolscript is a coding langauge
that is... well used for diffrent cases currently i plan it to be used for making operating systems and apps ill try make it be like swift so style funcations and database
ill plan to work on it on 2025 if you want you can make some things and contribute i guess. if you make a installsion process make sure to add te a tutotial in readme.md
maybe ill add macos support.and ill try to make the syntax as easy as possbile but the langauge as powerful as possible,please contruibte if you can.
